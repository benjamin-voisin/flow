# flow
This is a rewrite of [riverwm-utils](https://github.com/NickHastings/riverwm-utils) in Rust (very clich√©, I know).

## Features
- Cycle the focused tags, either to next or previous tag.

## Installation from source
1. Make sure you've got Rust installed. Either via your distributions package manager or [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/).
2. `cargo install --git https://github.com/stefur/flow flow`

## Usage
Currently the following commands can be used with flow.

| Command | Arguments | Description | Example |
